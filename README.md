# sudoku-solver
Solve Sudoku puzzles with rule based and backtracking approaches.

The plan
- Find and add to this repo several sudoku puzzles with different difficulty levels (easy to expert) for testing purposes.
- Check whether backtracking alone will work in reasonable time.
- Add solving rules similar how I would solve it and check how far can I go (medium/hard) without backtracking.
- Add text based UI?
