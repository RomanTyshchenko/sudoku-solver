# sudoku-solver
Solve Sudoku puzzles with rule based and backtracking approaches.

The plan
- Find and add to this repo several sudoku puzzles with different difficulty levels (easy to expert) for testing purposes.
- Check whether backtracking alone will work in reasonable time.
- Add solving rules similar how I would solve it and check how far can I go (medium/hard) without backtracking.
- Add text based UI?

The first set of puzzled I will take from 
http://lipas.uwasa.fi/~timan/sudoku/
because they are in text format which will be easy to read.

Cool!
I've just made my first commit from terminal.
I added a puzzles directory with files from the site above.
1. copied names from the site + echo + grep txt
2. bash loop with wget over filenames
3. git add directory
4. git commit
5. git push # entered my credentials
and done)

Now it's time to add a bit of code...
